# AWSEmulator
A Real-Data Emulator for the WIMEA-ICT Automatic Weather Station
AWSEmulator gets real data (as sent by AWS) from "sample.dat" in the root directory of the executable and pushes it to a given IP address (or host name) listening on a given port. You can also choose the delay between transmissions (use 0 for no delay).
